This repository contains a shell script that demonstrates a common yet subtle error when reading files line by line. The script attempts to read a file and print its contents, but it incorrectly handles empty lines or lines that contain only whitespace. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as omitting lines or printing extra blank lines.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle these cases using appropriate shell commands and parameter expansion.
